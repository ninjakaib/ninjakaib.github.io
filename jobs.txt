Summer 2025 Internship Program
About Etched

Etched is building AI chips that are hard-coded for individual model architectures. Our first product (Sohu) only supports transformers, but has an order of magnitude more throughput and lower latency than a B200. With Etched ASICs, you can build products that would be impossible with GPUs, like real-time video generation models and extremely deep chain-of-thought reasoning. 

Backed by $150M+ in funding from investors like Peter Thiel, Jane Street, and Two Sigma, we're scaling rapidly and looking for exceptional interns to join us in Summer 2025. Interns will get to work on cutting-edge engineering and business challenges across the following departments at Etched:

Hardware Engineering (ASIC):

Our Hardware team is designing next-generation silicon that runs transformer models faster than any chip in history. Led by Ajat Hukkoo (ex-Broadcom Distinguished Engineer, Intel VP) and Mark Ross (former Cypress CTO; shipped 5 different $1B+ silicon systems), our Hardware team is looking for excellent electrical and computer engineers to help us design and verify our next-gen silicon.

Architecture:

Our Architecture team, led by Saptadeep Pal (Co-founder/Chief Architect at Auradine, ex-NVIDIA architecture team), is designing the underlying chip architecture for our silicon. Architecture interns will help solve novel challenges in microarchitecture design to drive unprecedented FLOPS on our chip.

Platform Engineering:

Our Platform team is led by Brian Loiler, NVIDIA's former Senior Director of Datacenter Systems Engineering who built multiple generations of DGX and HGX. Scaling from single chips to full datacenter deployments requires solving complex challenges in thermal design, power delivery, system integration, and more. We're looking for exceptional electrical and mechanical engineers to join the Platform team and help us build state-of-the-art systems at scale.

Software Engineering and Machine Learning:

Our Software and Machine Learning teams build firmware, inference engines, and model infrastructure for Sohu. Our stack is engineered to optimize transformer performance - enabling capabilities that are impossible on general-purpose chips. The team is led by David Munday, who helped lead data center and TPU infrastructure at Google and DeepMind for 7 years. We're looking for leading SWEs and machine learning researchers across a variety of roles.

Operations:

The operations team is our special forces unit, working on the company's most critical business initiatives alongside our COO, Robert Wachen. We tackle problems through rigorous analysis, strategic planning, and relentless execution. We're looking for sharp, ambitious interns who can thrive under pressure, take complete ownership of complex problems, and deliver measurable results.

Go-to-Market:

The Go-to-Market team crafts the strategy and executes the plans to bring Sohu to market, helping customers leverage Sohu to build previously-impossible products. The team includes Chase Holmes, former top-seller at Databricks and MosaicML, and Alexandra Boyle, former CCO at Symphony, and operates under Robert, our COO who previously scaled Prod, an AI accelerator, to a $7B+ cohort valuation. We're looking for talented customer-facing interns to help accelerate our go-to-market engine.

Talent Acquisition:

The Talent team identifies and attracts the people who make up Etched. The team works directly with leadership to assemble world-class experts across all departments. We're looking for technical recruiting interns who can build relationships and source top talent.

Program Details:

12-week paid internship (June - August 2025)

Generous housing support for those relocating

Based at our office in San Jose, CA

Direct mentorship from industry leaders and world-class engineers

Opportunity to work on one of the most important problems of our time

How we’re different:

Etched believes in the Bitter Lesson. We think most of the progress in the AI field has come from using more FLOPs to train and run models, and the best way to get more FLOPs is to build model-specific hardware. Larger and larger training runs encourage companies to consolidate around fewer model architectures, which creates a market for single-model ASICs.

We are a fully in-person team in Cupertino, and greatly value engineering skills. We do not have boundaries between engineering and research, and we expect all of our technical staff to contribute to both as needed.

Etched was founded on the belief that new hardware will be needed to run human- and superhuman-level artificial intelligence. Our ASIC systems deliver orders of magnitude higher performance than conventional AI chips. Etched is actively developing Sohu, an ASIC exclusively for transformers, which will enable products that would be impossible with GPUs, like real-time video generation models and extremely deep chain-of-thought reasoning. And we're bringing this technology to market in months, not years. Sohu is hard-coded for individual model architectures and only supports transformers, but has an order of magnitude more throughput and lower latency than a B200.
