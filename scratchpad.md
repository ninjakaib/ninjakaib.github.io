By last summer, I, like most other people, had become pretty familiar with LLMs, they'd become an increasingly bigger part of my daily workflow and I felt like I had a pretty deep understanding of how the models work. With more use came more spending on API credits, which I quickly tired of paying for, so I started going down the rabbit hole of running models locally. Immediately after checking the prices of GPUs, I quickly grew un-tired of those api prices, and frustrated with Nvidia! Why do they only give 24gb of vram and charge $1500 for it? Surely it can't cost that much more to slap on a few more measly gigabytes, right? Oh, turns out they do that to make sure they can sell the datacenter cards for an even crazier price! This got me asking why there werent any better options for running AI models.

I started becoming very interested in how all of this hardware stuff actually worked under the hood. Coming from a data science background, its not something you really get exposed to at all, but I have always been very curious about how things work. I was spending hours of my free time after work and school reading everything I could about hardware and AI. I also had a new roommate who moved in around the same time who serendipitously worked as a hardware engineer at Apple, which I felt was like a sign from the universe that I might be onto something here, but I wasn't quite sure what it was. I dont remember exactly how I came to this realization, but one day I had this ephiphany about the combination of how scaling is improving models, the seemingly generalizeable nature of transformers and the hardware needed to run them. I had this idea that was basically: "what if there was a chip that was so closely tied to the architecture of a transformer that it was like an artificial brain, the synthetic biology that would enable a huge gain in intelligence." It felt like this could potentially be the most important problem in the world! How cool would it be to literally enable a new era of intelligence in the universe! What could something like that unlock for humanity? For about five minutes, I thought I was the most brilliant mind on planet Earth, until a few Google searches later when I discovered Etched.

Wow! It was pretty incredibly to me that someone had thought of this way back in 2022, before AI had taken the world by storm. Even more awe inspiring was the fact that the founder, Gavin, was the same age as me. Growing up in the Bay, it seemed like everyone in my circle was so tech oriented, and when someone would ask us as kids what we want to be when we grow up, there was a non insignificant number of us who replied "Steve Jobs" or something along those lines. I knew then that I had to be part of this revolutionary team, it was the most exciting project I'd ever heard of. So I kept learning as much as I could about transformer architecture details, serving stacks, GPU kernels, quantization, KV cache optimizations, software-hardware co-design, ASICs, and lower level hardware concepts like systolic arrays, memory management, dataflow, pipelining. I was determined to take this knowledge and actually use it to build something. For my university capstone project, I decided to take on the challenge of building my own AI accelerator completely from scratch. It was an amazing experience to be able to dive so deep into a concept that was new, and a significant challenge to complete the design, going from knowing essentially nothing to a full simulation capable of running a neural network and physical layout of the chip in just 12 weeks.

I cannot express just how excited I would be to be able to join this amazing team of talented engineers, working on what I truly believe is one of the most important problems of our time. I am willing to learn whatever it takes, take on any challenge, and work insanely hard to help you guys make Sohu become a reality!

My journey to discovering Etched began last summer when I started exploring running LLMs locally. Frustrated with GPU limitations and API costs, I dove deep into understanding the hardware constraints of AI acceleration. This exploration coincided with my growing interest in transformer architectures and their scaling properties.

What started as curiosity evolved into a conviction: specialized hardware for transformers could fundamentally change AI's trajectory. When I discovered Etched was already pioneering this exact vision since 2022, I was both impressed and inspired by the team's foresight before the AI boom.

To prepare myself for contributing to this field, I immersed myself in transformer architectures, serving stacks, GPU kernels, quantization, KV cache optimizations, and hardware concepts like systolic arrays and pipelining. For my university capstone project, I designed and built an AI accelerator from scratch, taking it from concept to full simulation capable of running neural networks and completing the physical layout in just 12 weeks.

My project experience with [specific relevant technologies/approaches] aligns directly with Etched's work on Sohu. I'm particularly excited about [specific aspect of their technology] and how it addresses [specific challenge].

I believe Etched is working on one of the most important technological challenges of our time. The opportunity to help build hardware that could enable the next generation of AI capabilities would be the perfect application of my skills in [your key relevant skills]. I'm ready to learn whatever it takes and work relentlessly to help make Sohu a reality.

## Why do you want to join Etched?

By last summer, I had become pretty familiar with LLMs as they'd become an increasingly bigger part of my daily workflow. With more use came more spending on API credits, which I quickly tired of paying for, so I started exploring running models locally. After checking GPU prices, I quickly grew un-tired of those API costs! The frustration with Nvidia's pricing strategy ($1500 for just 24GB of VRAM?) sparked a deeper curiosity about hardware limitations in AI.

I dove headfirst into understanding how all this hardware actually worked under the hood. Coming from a data science background at UC San Diego, it wasn't something I'd been exposed to, but I've always been passionate about learning how things work down to the lowest level details. I spent hours after classes and work reading research papers, learning everything I could about hardware and AI acceleration, and discussing ideas with my roommate who works as a hardware engineer at Apple.

Then came my epiphany: what if there was a chip so closely tied to transformer architecture that it functioned like an artificial brain—the synthetic biology that would enable a quantum leap in intelligence? For about five minutes, I thought I was the most brilliant mind on Earth, until Google searches led me to Etched. I was blown away that Gavin had this vision back in 2022, before AI had taken the world by storm. Growing up in the Bay Area, tech ambitions were always in the air, and joining a startup like this has always been a dream of mine. Discovering Etched felt like finding the perfect intersection of hardware innovation and AI's future—immediately, I thought to myself, "this is something I have to be a part of!"

I channeled this passion into action, teaching myself transformer architecture details, serving stacks, GPU kernels, quantization techniques, and hardware concepts like systolic arrays and pipelining. For my university capstone project, I built my own AI accelerator completely from scratch—going from minimal hardware knowledge to a full simulation capable of running neural networks with a complete physical layout in just 10 weeks. This project taught me how to implement energy-efficient multipliers that achieved significant improvements in area, power, and delay while maintaining model accuracy, testing and functionally verifying hardware, and how to design basic accelerator cores for AI. I feel everything I learned about software hardware co-design from this project, plus working with transformers and deploying them for production inference at work makes me a really strong fit for the team at Etched.

My ability to learn quickly and perform under pressure extends beyond academics. I spent two years at California's 5th busiest In-N-Out, where I learned to thrive in absolute chaos while maintaining quality. That experience taught me how to stay focused and effective when everything's moving at warp speed—coordinating seamlessly with teammates, adapting instantly to problems, and delivering consistently even during the craziest rushes. These skills would help me excel in a fast-paced startup environment.

I cannot express how excited I would be to join your team of talented engineers, working on what I truly believe is one of the most important problems in the world. I'm all in on the big bet, and I'm ready to learn whatever it takes, take on any challenge, and work insanely hard to help make Sohu a reality.
