# XiFin Machine Learning Engineering Internship Projects (June 2024 - Present)

## 1. IDE-Integrated Code Assistant

- Built a private GitHub Copilot alternative using open-source LLMs (Llama, Qwen)
- Features:
  - Context-aware code suggestions using project-specific code retrieval
  - Inline code editing with diff preview
  - Real-time autocomplete
- Technical Implementation:
  - AWS SageMaker for model hosting
  - Custom Docker inference containers
  - VSCode extension development with React/TypeScript
  - Built no-code model deployment tool using FastAPI and Gradio
  - Supported acceleration techniques:
    - Quantization
    - Speculative decoding
    - Hardware optimization (AWS Neuron, vLLM, HF TGI)

## 2. Healthcare Pricing Data Parser

- Purpose: Process insurance MRF files for payor transparency monitoring
- Technical Details:
  - Custom Python parser with C backends (ijson)
  - Optimizations:
    - Multi-processing and threading
    - Concurrent I/O for S3 uploads
    - Resource-optimized instance utilization
  - Database redesign:
    - Normalized schema to reduce redundancy
    - Automated ETL pipeline via SageMaker
    - Integration with frontend viewer
  - Results:
    - ~100x increase in processing speed
    - 75% reduction in storage costs
    - Added support for Blue Shield CA and Humana
- See the frontend [here](https://www.xifin.com/resources/payor-rate-transparency-monitor/) (this part was not developed by me!)
